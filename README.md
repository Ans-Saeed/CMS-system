# About My Project

## Project Idea

I was thinking about a content management system where everyone who connected with development and programming, so they can share their knowledge in an open platform. We can see that many CSE students want to build their career in developing whereas some of them lose the track. So here I got an idea where the experts will share their knowledge by posting many content and people can follow the suggestions. There will be a comment system where people will ask their queries in the relevant topic and will get their answers. It will be a great platform where experts can share their best knowledge and students will not fall out from the track.
